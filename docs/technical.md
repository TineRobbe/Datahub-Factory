_Datahub::Factory_

## Catmandu base
_Datahub::Factory_ is built on [Catmandu]() and leverages it to do the importing, fixing and exporting.

The plugins are mostly wrappers around Catmandu modules (stores, importers or exporters) that implement the actual actions. Most Catmandu [stores](), [importers]() and [exporters]() can be used as the basis for a plugin (see [extending](extending) for more information).
